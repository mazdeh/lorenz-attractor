# Lorenz Attractor
A modeling of the Lorenz Attractor with 50,000 points, that I probably spent about 4 hours on, written in C for OpenGL.

## Key Bindings:
'y' to zoom in.
'h' to zoom out.
'esc' to exit.
right, left, top and bottom arrows to change view angle.

## Manipulate Lorenz Paramaters:
'+' to increase the s parameter by 1.
'-' to decrease the s parameter by 1.
